- properties
- static classes and members
- events
- array syntax (declaration, access, etc.)
- operators
- indexers
- delegates (and lambdas)
- Action (and Func)
- using and lock statements
- pragmas
- ref/out parameters
- implicit and explicit conversions and extension methods
- break/continue/goto statements
- :? and ?? expressions
- post- and prefix increment/decrement operators
- lifted operators
- sizeof
- is/as operator (and special cast syntax)
- unsafe
- array/collection initializers
- default keyword
- syntax sugar for nullable types (?)
- `__arglist`, `__makeref`, `__reftype`, `__refvalue` keywords
- partial types and members

Scala has none of the items mentioned above ... and I haven't even looked at LINQ and expression trees. I'm pretty sure I can quadruple this list without breaking a sweat.
