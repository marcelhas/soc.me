Sadly, it has become increasingly obvious that user experience will always take
the backseat.

<!--
- Making Scala easier to learn, easier to understand and easier to use
- Improving the overall quality of the language, its libraries, its tooling and
  documentation
- Removing harmful elements, pointless syntactic and semantic distinctions and
  superfluous cruft from the language and its libraries -->

Therefore I'm leaving Scala due to the failure to acknowledge or address any of
the following problems in any sufficient way:

- Deteriorating language quality caused by low-quality changes and proposals,
  excessive layers of middle management and design-by-committee
- Decisions and actions that erect higher barriers, cause unnecessary pain and
  create pointless work for developers who want to contribute to Scala
- After-the-fact-rationalization of issues, defending status quo instead of
  accepting fixes
- Introduction of compatibility breakages in minor versions of the language
  (compare  http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compatibility.html)
- Lack of vision and planning in the further evolution of Scala
- Lack of interest in addressing severe issues in the language, its libraries
  and its tooling
- Lack of interest in addressing severe issues in documentation, the official
  website and overall communication, hurting adoption of the language
- Inward focus of the language, making it hard to attract new developers
  outside of the "Java developers tired of Java" niche.
- Continued failure to attract and retain contributors due to poor treatment
- Copyright violations which endanger both the project itself as well as users
  of the language

As it had become abundantly clear, my vision has not been shared.

Going forward, I don't believe that any kind of continued work on Scala is an
effective use of my time.

Therefore I have ceased development, maintenance and support for the following
projects, fixes and improvements:

- scala: deprecations, enums, annotations
- scala-android.org
- get-scala.org
- scala-java-time
- sbs
- bigint (see license sitaution in Scala.js/Scala-Native)
- sbt-testng
- documentation (wiki, scala-lang, docs, spec, get-satisfaction)
- website
- scala-native: scala-java-time, regex, collections, FP signaling NaN fixes
