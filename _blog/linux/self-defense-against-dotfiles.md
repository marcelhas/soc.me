Here are a few practical steps for Linux users that are fed up with applications littering in their home directory:

### Step 1: Adjust some environment variables

Add the following line to `.pam_environment`:

    ICEAUTHORITY DEFAULT=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/ICEauthority.

Add the following lines to `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` (if you use LightDM)

    [LightDM]
    user-authority-in-system-dir=true

or try adding

    XAUTHORITY DEFAULT=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/Xauthority

to `.pam_environment` (this might or might not work depending on the display manager).

### Step 2: Check whether applications support the XDG base directory spec

Check whether existing dot-files and dot-directories can be moved â€“
many applications already support the XDG base directory specification,
but do not move existing files:

  - Rename an application's dot-files/dot-directories, start the application and check whether the
    application created entries for itself in `.config` or `.cache`.
  - If this is the case, migrate existing dot-files to those directories
    (likely renaming them in the process).

### Step 3: File bug reports

Check whether bug reports exist for the remaining applications or file new bug reports.
  The Arch wiki entry on
  [XDG Base Directory support](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support)
  is an invaluable resource.

### Step 4: Make `$HOME` read-only (yes, really)

Run

    chmod -222 $HOME

to prevent the creation of new dot-files and dot-directories in your home directory.

----

From this point on, the number of dot-files and dot-directories can only shrink
as the remaining applications get fixed and start conforming to the
[XDG base directory spec](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html),
while no new dot-files and dot-directories can be added to your
home directory.
