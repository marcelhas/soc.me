Paul's departure in xx from Scala came as a big shock to me as his code and his
commit messages taught me more about software development than anything else.

It felt like I lost my biggest ally that day, but I decided that I would keep
fighting.

His relentless no-nonsense attitude toward quality in both the compiler and the standard
library meant that.

After he left, I realized that Scala's culture had significantly changed.
Without his visible example of critically reevaluating language and library
design decisions it seemed like fewer and fewer people felt safe to publicly
question these decisions, while the amount of people who were willing to defend
obvious mistakes grew.
