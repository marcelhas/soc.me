I have interacted with various communities before joining Scala, but only
stepping away from the Scala community for a while made me realize how toxic it
had become.

I have never found another community that has splintered into so many different
factions, all holding substantial grudges against each other.

While there were many spectacular individuals who I felt actively lowered the
_average_ toxicity of the community immensely, the _median_ toxicity was at a
level hard to find elsewhere.

Having been a part of that community for so long, I learned to identify
different factions of the community by their approach to dealing with conflicts.

- Do you prefer to be publicly banished or silently shadow-banned?
- Do you be rather be insulted over social media or by email?
- Do you find it more agreeable to be compared to a sexual assailant or have
  your place of work harassed?
- Do you fancy calls to boycott your conferences or reading treatises about the
  necessity to insult people to ensure software quality?

I can point you to the right faction of the community, because all of these
incidents have happened (I'm withholding the victims' identities for their own
safety).

I believe that this is not normal.

I'm perfectly clear that the toxicity also had a personal impact on me ...
