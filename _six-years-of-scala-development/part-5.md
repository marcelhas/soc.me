One thing that also felt weird to me was the lack of empathy and compassion
toward new people who wanted to learn the language.

A plausible explanation I heard was that Scala suffered from a massive
selection-bias where a large fraction of people successfully adopting Scala
managed to learn Scala _despite_ all the difficulties, while many potential
users that needed better documentation just gave up and walked away.

Actively selecting for users that can deal with the lack of up-to-date
documentation, easy to understand tutorials, working installation instructions,
and actively selecting against users that don't have the necessary time or money
created a self-sustaining and -reinforcing cycle where those who did not care
about beginner issues were always in the majority, while those who struggled and
needed better documentation lacked a voice.

I tried, but I failed to change that.
