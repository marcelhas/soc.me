Opinions often differ depending on whether you come from a more imperative,
low-level background or a functional, more high-level background.

Unfortunate conflation between information provided to the runtime to improve
execution and information provided to the developer to increase power.

No necessary connection between those two.

In that sense, both groups are right.

Also Java – erasure vs. C# – no erasure paints a black-and-white picture that's
a poor representation of wide variety of approaches between "full" erasure and
"no" erasure.

Erasure – Reification – Specialization

Reification = Specialization + Reflection/Introspection?
