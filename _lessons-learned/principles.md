#### Principles

- Does it work?
  - scala.mobile
- Is it documented?
  - scala.text
  - scala.util.parsing
- Is it necessary?
  - scala.test
  - octals
  - procedures
  - view bounds
- Is it obvious?
  - dot-after-floating-point
  - tuple0 adaption
- Fix stuff where it is broken
- Does it use the least power?
  - library instead of language feature
  - scaladoc tag instead of annotation
  - annotation instead of language feature
  - IDE fix instead of language feature
