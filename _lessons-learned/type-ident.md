#### Why is `ident: Type` better than `Type ident`?

**Names are more important**

In expressive languages, developers generally need to use less temporary variables.
This means that in a typical piece of code there are fewer names defined, but
those names carry higher importance.

Scala let's developers focus on them by placing them first.

**Type inference**

As Scala has type inference (which means that the compiler can figure out types on its own) it also ensures that the names can be found at a glance, regardless of whether you write they type down or let it be inferred by the compiler:

```scala
val x: String = "hello"
val y: Int = 23
val z = 42

// vs.

val String x = "hello"
val Int y = 23
val z = 42
```

**Input before output**

The `i: Int` syntax naturally leads to a method syntax where the inputs (parameters) are defined before the output (result type), which in turn leads to more consistency with lambdas (whose inputs are also defined before its output).

**Consistency between definition and usage**

The way a method is defined should mirror the way it can be used. (See [Why is `[]` better than `<>` for generic types?](generics))

**Definition before usage**

A generic type parameter should be declared before it is used. Otherwise it's hard to tell to what a type argument refers to:

```java
class Id<T>() {
  T id<T>(T \ivalue) { ... } // Does T refer to the class' <T> in scope,
}                            // or to the method's <T> that comes after it?
```

As languages have explored various designs, we can check whether they satisfy the three desirable properties mentioned above:

**Java**

```java
<T> T id(T value) { ... }
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
fun <T> id(value: T) { TODO() }
```

**Ceylon**

```ceylon
T id<T>(T \ivalue) { ... }
```

**Scala**

```scala
def id[T](value: T): T = ???
```

Scala's design choice is the only one that delivers all three desirable properties:

|              | Input before output | Definition-usage consistency | Definition before usage |
|--------------|:-------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------:|

| ***Kotlin*** | Yes                 | No                           | Yes                     |
| ***Ceylon*** | No                  | Yes                          | No                      |
