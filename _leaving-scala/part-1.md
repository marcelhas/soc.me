title:  "Leaving Scala Development – Part I – Introduction"

For the last five years I had been deeply committed to improving Scala's
developer experience: Making Scala easier to learn, easier to understand and
easier to use.

My decision to adopt Scala and start working on it was not lead by the
impression that the language was perfect, but by the fact that the developers
where willing to critically assess the language and its library and correct
mistakes that were identified in the process.

After comparing the development philosophy of many different languages, I
finally had discovered a language philosophy where "good enough" was not
considered an acceptable quality standard, despite – _or maybe due to_ – the
large amount of mistakes that had been made and addressed in the early days of
Scala.

I had the impression that past errors informed the actions of Scala developers
and prevented them from repeating the same or similar mistakes over and over.

It felt that I was working in an environment where "better than language X"
was a necessary but not sufficient requirement for language features and library
additions.

Finally I had found a language where people asked "what is the _best_
thing we can do?" instead of accepting the mediocrity of "this is how it has
always been done elsewhere, let's just copy it"!

For me, this is what made Scala stand out in the vast sea of worse-is-better
languages: Not its state at that time, but the prospect of continuous
improvement toward a better, more minimal, more orthogonal language, while
preserving and extending its expressiveness through generalizing existing
functionality, not through tacking on new features.

Earlier this year, I have come to the conclusion that this philosophy has
deteriorated to a point where I don't feel that continued work on Scala is not a
good use of my time.

More specifically, I'm leaving Scala due to the failure to acknowledge or
address any of the following concerns in any sufficient way:

- Deteriorating language quality caused by low-quality changes and proposals,
  excessive layers of middle management and design-by-committee
- Decisions and actions that erect higher barriers, cause unnecessary pain and
  create pointless work for developers who want to contribute to Scala
- Introduction of compatibility breakages in minor versions of the language
- Lack of vision and planning in the further evolution of Scala
- Lack of interest in addressing severe issues in the language, its libraries
  and its tooling
- Lack of interest in addressing severe issues in documentation, the official
  website and overall communication, hurting adoption of the language
- Inward focus of the language, making it hard to attract new developers
  outside of the "I'm tired of Java" niche.
- Continued failure to attract and retain contributors due to poor treatment by
  leadership
- Copyright violations which endanger both the project itself as well as users
  of the language
