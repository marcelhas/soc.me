### Motivation

For the last five years I had been deeply committed to improving Scala's
developer experience: Making Scala easier to learn, easier to understand and
easier to use.

My efforts where focused on improving the lives of Scala developers, especially
removing the friction for newcomers, making the language more attractive to a
wider audience and increasing overall adoption.

While it would have certainly been more convenient to focus only on the good
parts of Scala, I found it extremely important to learn through users' real
experiences where Scala failed or did worse compared to other languages.

To better understand the issues people were struggling with, I made sure to not
simply interview users that were already sold on Scala, but went the extra mile
and sought out the experiences of developers who decided against learning Scala,
developers who learned Scala but didn't adopt it for their projects, and
developers who left Scala.

These experiences, with strong focus on understanding the mistakes of the past
and not repeating them, informed my work on the compiler, the standard library,
the documentation, and the website and many other parts of the ecosystem.

#### Guiding Principles

- Does it work
- Is it necessary
- Is it obvious
- Does it use the least power to achieve its goals
