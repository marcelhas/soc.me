### Conclusion

As it had become abundantly clear, my vision has not been shared by leadership.

Going forward, I don't believe that any kind of continued work on Scala is an
effective use of my time.

Therefore I have ceased development, maintenance and support for the following
projects, fixes and improvements:

    scala: deprecations, enums, annotations
    scala-android.org
    get-scala.org
    scala-java-time
    sbs
    bigint (see license sitaution in Scala.js/Scala-Native)
    sbt-testng
    documentation (wiki, scala-lang, docs, spec, get-satisfaction)
    website
    scala-native: scala-java-time, regex, collections, FP signaling NaN fixes
